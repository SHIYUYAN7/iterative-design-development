            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this project, we designed an interactive prototype for Allara’s website based on the problems they face on their original website. Allara is a company that provides virtual care for women’s hormonal and metabolic health. </p>

        <section id="low-fi">
            <h2>Low-fi Wireframe</h2>
            <p>For our first low-fidelity wireframe, we chose designs from our sketches that would best solve the problems the client had with the site. More specifically, we addressed the problem of users potentially being unfamiliar with Allara, uncertain if it suits their needs, and being skeptical about the doctors by changing the flow of the content, and adding narratives as well as interactive elements. In addition, we tried to make choices that would allow personalized and inclusive experiences for the users.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/welcome-page.png" alt="image of welcome page">
                        <p>Welcome Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/treatment-history-page.png" alt="image of treatment history page">
                        <p>Treatment History Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Firstly, we changed the flow of content, using ideas from two of our sketches. In the original version of the site, the screen that checks for user eligibility for the program was provided as the third screen, but we decided to bring this to the first <b>Welcome Page</b> because we thought that this would reduce unnecessary processes for those who are not eligible for the program.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we chose the sketch that redesigned the progress bar, where a percentage number was added so that color-blind people could also see their current progress, example shown on <b>Treatment History Page</b>.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/expert-care-page.png" alt="image of expert care page">
                        <p>Expert Care Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/medical-care.png" alt="image of treatment medical care page">
                        <p>Medical Care Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/specialist-page.png" alt="image of specialist page">
                        <p>Specialist Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Thirdly, we used the idea to include an additional page to solve the problem of users not knowing who Allara is and being skeptical of doctors. The purpose of this page was to give a brief introduction to what Allara provides in order to motivate the users to go through the questions and sign up that follow because in the original website, information about Allara was only given near the end of the entire process. In <b>Expert Care Page</b>, we used three buttons that users could click which would lead to a page that would lead to a description of specialists at Allara shown as <b>Specialists Page</b>, a detailed description on the medical care shown as <b>Medical Care Page</b>, and a detailed description on the nutrition support. These buttons were implemented instead of having all the details on one page because we did not want to make the screen text heavy or for users who are familiar with Allara to have to go through the information that they already know. Pictures were added in all of the detail pages to allow a visually intuitive understanding and to break up the text to decrease the density of text. </p>     
        
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/have-previous-diagnoses-page.png" alt="image of have previous diagnoses page">
                        <p>Previous Diagnoses Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/join-program-page.png" alt="image of treatment Join Program Page">
                        <p>Join Program Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Fourthly, we implemented the idea of adding a <b>Previous Diagnoses Page</b> page from one of our sketches. This page was added so that users who click “yes” would be directed to the “diagnosed history” page that was in the original site, while users who click “no” would skip the “diagnosed history” page. The aim of this change was to reduce the amount of text that users who do not have previous diagnoses have to go through and to increase readability. </p>
            <p>Fifthly, we also implemented the idea of adding a page after all the questions required before the sign-up has been asked. The aim of <b>Join Program Page</b> was to give a break point in the process where the users are told that they have finished answering the questions and to indicate that what is left is to join and sign up for the program. Providing a brief sentence on how the questions answered so far will be used for a personalized plan when signing up for the program, would motivate the users to join the program.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/uncovered-plan-page.png" alt="image of uncovered plan page">
                        <p>Uncovered Plan Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/confirmation-page.png" alt="image of confirmation page">
                        <p>Confirmation Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Moreover, we used the design decision to make a horizontally swipeable card of the subscription plans with buttons also included at the top to jump to a specific subscription plan to increase readability and to add interactive elements for users, shown on <b>uncovered Plan Page</b></p>
            <p>Lastly, we implemented the idea to include a <b>Confirmation Page</b> for users at the end of the entire process so that they can check the information they entered and easily confirm that they have successfully joined the program. </p>
