            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this project, we designed an interactive prototype for Allara’s website based on the problems they face on their original website. Allara is a company that provides virtual care for women’s hormonal and metabolic health. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="goal">
            <h2>Prototype Goal</h2>
            <p>Based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AGgqCQjKFn_yIY2Hy9cYK2RnHGvFB9JPzfeC64xWepc/edit?usp=sharing">project brief</a> provided by our client, we communicated with our client to clarify our understanding of the target customers, problems faced on their original website, and some ideas on the complexity of the final design. 
                The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbHZPqNgawZxE8YENLRMMEAKU2Ki8oVYVv82mLOVDuc/edit?usp=sharing">revised project brief</a> was created with the additional insights obtained.</p>
            <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients are not sure if Allara is the right fit for them</li>
                <li>Patients do not know who Allara is</li>
                <li>Patients are skeptical of doctors</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="low-fi">
            <h2>Low-fi Wireframe</h2>
            <p>For our first low-fidelity wireframe, we chose designs from our sketches that would best solve the problems the client had with the site. More specifically, we addressed the problem of users potentially being unfamiliar with Allara, uncertain if it suits their needs, and being skeptical about the doctors by changing the flow of the content, and adding narratives as well as interactive elements. In addition, we tried to make choices that would allow personalized and inclusive experiences for the users.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="updated-low-fi">
            <h2>Update Low-fi Wireframe after Critiques</h2>
            <p>Following the valuable feedback received from our instructor, client, and peers, we proceeded to update our low-fidelity wireframe for Allara Health's onboarding flow. This <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/n8RuLRnTVZAYtC7EViOqKS/Allara-Wireframe?type=design&node-id=192%3A2&mode=design&t=bo6AhIDIktOV7UTx-1">second iteration</a> incorporates several key changes based on the critiques and suggestions provided.</p>
            <p>We implemented the following changes based on our client's feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Added a "continue" button on each page of the specialist, medical care, and nutrition support sections to maintain user engagement within the signup flow</li>
                <li> Removed the referral question and the hormonal & metabolic evaluation program, as they were no longer relevant</li>
                <li>Combined bullets 3, 4, and 5 as they all refer to 1:1 visits with providers</li>
                <li>Removed the community offering</li>
                <li>Adjusted the progress bar to end at the review page, making the onboarding process appear more manageable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also made the following changes based on our peers' feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used the expert section from Allara's "About" page to provide descriptions on the specialist page</li>
                <li>Added more padding to the button text to improve readability</li>
                <li>Incorporated two guidance dots for swiping or scrolling</li>
                <li>Featured real-world patient testimonials from Allara Health's website to showcase the program's benefits</li>
                <li>Added a "read more" and "read less" button for the "Your insurance will be billed for" section on the covered page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, we decided not to include some suggestions in this low-fidelity iteration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our instructor's suggestion to enhance the visual design will be addressed in our high-fidelity prototype.</li>
                <li>The peer feedback regarding adding color, fun elements, and pictures will also be incorporated in the high-fidelity prototype, where we can better explore visual design choices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By selectively implementing the most relevant and impactful changes in this second iteration, we have created an improved low-fidelity wireframe that better aligns with our client's goals and addresses key user experience concerns raised by our peers.</p>
            <p>This iterative process has reinforced the importance of seeking and incorporating feedback from multiple stakeholders to refine and enhance our design solution. As we move forward to the high-fidelity prototyping stage, we will continue to keep the remaining suggestions in mind to create a visually engaging and user-friendly onboarding experience for Allara Health.</p>
