        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, we designed an interactive prototype for Allara’s
          website based on the problems they face on their original website.
          Allara is a company that provides virtual care for women’s hormonal
          and metabolic health.

          provided by our client, we communicated with our client to clarify our
          understanding of the target customers, problems faced on their
          original website, and some ideas on the complexity of the final
          design. The

        <h2>Low-fi Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          For our first low-fidelity wireframe, we chose designs from our
          sketches that would best solve the problems the client had with the
          site. More specifically, we addressed the problem of users potentially
          being unfamiliar with Allara, uncertain if it suits their needs, and
          being skeptical about the doctors by changing the flow of the content,
          and adding narratives as well as interactive elements. In addition, we
          tried to make choices that would allow personalized and inclusive
          experiences for the users.

        <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
        <div class="vsg">
          <div class="single-image-container">
            <img
              src="./assets/VisualStyleGuide.png"
              alt="picture of visual style guide"
              style="height: 500px; width: 900px"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            For the design of color, font and size, we chose and kept it
            consistent with the original design to the greatest extent,
            including all of the text sizes, the effect of mouse hover, the
            color after being selected, and the original color of the button,
            etc. For the customer review cards, we also added a three-dot icon
            for the sliding window and made it the same color as the theme color
            so that it can blend in with the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we also made some changes to the original design.
            For example, on the input box, we added a shadow to the selected and
            hover input box. In this way, users who are not sensitive to color
            can clearly see the input box they selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the design of the icon, we implemented three blue buttons to
            increase the interactivity of the page. Users can expand more
            content by clicking buttons. By browsing this content, users can
            have a clearer understanding of the product and decide whether this
            program is suitable for them. In addition, we also added the checked
            mark for the check box to ensure that color-blind people can also
            see that they have checked this box by the presentation of the
            checked mark, not only the color changing in this box. In the same
            way, we have increased the percentage under the progress bar to
            better serve the visually impaired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, for the card and drop-down box designs, we chose to keep
            the default designs because the client wants us to keep it simple.
            In addition, we believe that the color of the card is close to the
            background color of the page, which may not be conducive to people
            with visual impairments. Therefore, we recommend the client to
            consider using other colors to design cards.
