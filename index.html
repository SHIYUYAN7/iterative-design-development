        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, we designed an interactive prototype for Allara’s
          website based on the problems they face on their original website.
          Allara is a company that provides virtual care for women’s hormonal
          and metabolic health.

        <section id="low-fi">
            <h2>Low-fi Wireframe</h2>
            <p>For our first low-fidelity wireframe, we chose designs from our sketches that would best solve the problems the client had with the site. More specifically, we addressed the problem of users potentially being unfamiliar with Allara, uncertain if it suits their needs, and being skeptical about the doctors by changing the flow of the content, and adding narratives as well as interactive elements. In addition, we tried to make choices that would allow personalized and inclusive experiences for the users.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/welcome-page.png" alt="image of welcome page">
                        <p>Welcome Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/treatment-history-page.png" alt="image of treatment history page">
                        <p>Treatment History Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Firstly, we changed the flow of content, using ideas from two of our sketches. In the original version of the site, the screen that checks for user eligibility for the program was provided as the third screen, but we decided to bring this to the first <b>Welcome Page</b> because we thought that this would reduce unnecessary processes for those who are not eligible for the program.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we chose the sketch that redesigned the progress bar, where a percentage number was added so that color-blind people could also see their current progress, example shown on <b>Treatment History Page</b>.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/expert-care-page.png" alt="image of expert care page">
                        <p>Expert Care Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/medical-care.png" alt="image of treatment medical care page">
                        <p>Medical Care Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/specialist-page.png" alt="image of specialist page">
                        <p>Specialist Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Thirdly, we used the idea to include an additional page to solve the problem of users not knowing who Allara is and being skeptical of doctors. The purpose of this page was to give a brief introduction to what Allara provides in order to motivate the users to go through the questions and sign up that follow because in the original website, information about Allara was only given near the end of the entire process. In <b>Expert Care Page</b>, we used three buttons that users could click which would lead to a page that would lead to a description of specialists at Allara shown as <b>Specialists Page</b>, a detailed description on the medical care shown as <b>Medical Care Page</b>, and a detailed description on the nutrition support. These buttons were implemented instead of having all the details on one page because we did not want to make the screen text heavy or for users who are familiar with Allara to have to go through the information that they already know. Pictures were added in all of the detail pages to allow a visually intuitive understanding and to break up the text to decrease the density of text. </p>     
        
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/have-previous-diagnoses-page.png" alt="image of have previous diagnoses page">
                        <p>Previous Diagnoses Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/join-program-page.png" alt="image of treatment Join Program Page">
                        <p>Join Program Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Fourthly, we implemented the idea of adding a <b>Previous Diagnoses Page</b> page from one of our sketches. This page was added so that users who click “yes” would be directed to the “diagnosed history” page that was in the original site, while users who click “no” would skip the “diagnosed history” page. The aim of this change was to reduce the amount of text that users who do not have previous diagnoses have to go through and to increase readability. </p>
            <p>Fifthly, we also implemented the idea of adding a page after all the questions required before the sign-up has been asked. The aim of <b>Join Program Page</b> was to give a break point in the process where the users are told that they have finished answering the questions and to indicate that what is left is to join and sign up for the program. Providing a brief sentence on how the questions answered so far will be used for a personalized plan when signing up for the program, would motivate the users to join the program.</p>
            
            <div class="two-mobile-images-container">
                <div class="two-mobile-images-box">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/uncovered-plan-page.png" alt="image of uncovered plan page">
                        <p>Alternative Plan Page</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/confirmation-page.png" alt="image of confirmation page">
                        <p>Confirmation Page</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Moreover, we used the design decision to make a horizontally swipeable card of the subscription plans with buttons also included at the top to jump to a specific subscription plan to increase readability and to add interactive elements for users, shown on <b>uncovered Plan Page</b></p>
            <p>Lastly, we implemented the idea to include a <b>Confirmation Page</b> for users at the end of the entire process so that they can check the information they entered and easily confirm that they have successfully joined the program. </p>

        <h2>Update Low-fi Wireframe after Critiques</h2>
        <p>
          Following the valuable feedback received from our instructor, client,
          and peers, we proceeded to update our low-fidelity wireframe for
          Allara Health's onboarding flow. This

            >second iteration</a
          >
          incorporates several key changes based on the critiques and
          suggestions provided.

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We implemented the following changes based on our client's feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added a "continue" button on each page of the specialist, medical
            care, and nutrition support sections to maintain user engagement
            within the signup flow
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed the referral question and the hormonal & metabolic
            evaluation program, as they were no longer relevant
          </li>
          <li>
            Combined bullets 3, 4, and 5 as they all refer to 1:1 visits with
            providers
          </li>
          <li>Removed the community offering</li>
          <li>
            Adjusted the progress bar to end at the review page, making the
            onboarding process appear more manageable
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also made the following changes based on our peers' feedback:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Used the expert section from Allara's "About" page to provide
            descriptions on the specialist page
          </li>
          <li>Added more padding to the button text to improve readability</li>
          <li>Incorporated two guidance dots for swiping or scrolling</li>
          <li>
            Featured real-world patient testimonials from Allara Health's
            website to showcase the program's benefits
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a "read more" and "read less" button for the "Your insurance
            will be billed for" section on the covered page
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, we decided not to include some suggestions in this
          low-fidelity iteration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our instructor's suggestion to enhance the visual design will be
            addressed in our high-fidelity prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            The peer feedback regarding adding color, fun elements, and pictures
            will also be incorporated in the high-fidelity prototype, where we
            can better explore visual design choices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By selectively implementing the most relevant and impactful changes in
          this second iteration, we have created an improved low-fidelity
          wireframe that better aligns with our client's goals and addresses key
          user experience concerns raised by our peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This iterative process has reinforced the importance of seeking and
          incorporating feedback from multiple stakeholders to refine and
          enhance our design solution. As we move forward to the high-fidelity
          prototyping stage, we will continue to keep the remaining suggestions
          in mind to create a visually engaging and user-friendly onboarding
          experience for Allara Health.

        <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
        <div class="vsg">
          <div class="single-image-container">
            <img
              src="./assets/VisualStyleGuide.png"
              alt="picture of visual style guide"
              style="height: 500px; width: 900px; border: 1px solid #000000;"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            For the design of color, font and size, we chose and kept it
            consistent with the original design to the greatest extent,
            including all of the text sizes, the effect of mouse hover, the
            color after being selected, and the original color of the button,
            etc. For the customer review cards, we also added a three-dot icon
            for the sliding window and made it the same color as the theme color
            so that it can blend in with the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we also made some changes to the original design.
            For example, on the input box, we added a shadow to the selected,
            hover button and input box. In this way, users who are not sensitive
            to color can clearly see the input box they selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the design of the icon, we implemented three blue buttons to
            increase the interactivity of the page. Users can expand more
            content by clicking buttons. By browsing this content, users can
            have a clearer understanding of the product and decide whether this
            program is suitable for them. In addition, we also added the checked
            mark for the check box to ensure that color-blind people can also
            see that they have checked this box by the presentation of the
            checked mark, not only the color changing in this box. In the same
            way, we have increased the percentage under the progress bar to
            better serve the visually impaired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, for the card and drop-down box designs, we chose to keep
            the default designs because the client wants us to keep it simple.
            In addition, we believe that the color of the card is close to the
            background color of the page, which may not be conducive to people
            with visual impairments. Therefore, we recommend the client to
            consider using other colors to design cards.
